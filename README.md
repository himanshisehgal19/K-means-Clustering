# K-means-Clustering
## Problem Statement
Form a collage which contains of different images with  n number of dominant color of the image.

## Libraries Used
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Sklearn
## Image Segmentation
Image segmentation is an important step in image processing, and it seems everywhere if we want to analyze whatâ€™s inside the image.
The goal of Image segmentation is to change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze.

## k-means Clustering
k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster.
